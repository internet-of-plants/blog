In the last TODO weeks, we have been working hard on watr.li. Today marks the deadline for the Eclipse IoT Challenge, so we'd like to take the opportunity to summarize what we've made.  
In this wrapup post, we do not only want to present the fruits of our labour, but also go into what we've learned, which mistakes we made, and which future steps we'd like to take with watr.li.

## Introducing watr.li

<!-- EMBED VIDEO HERE -->

## Outtakes

<!-- Where we fucked up, what we could've done better, what we underestimated... -->
- microcoap: level of embedded implementations: YMMV; nodes are aussmed to be so dumb that they have to be asked for their data instead of sending it autonomously
- network stack: without ND, we're forced to employ dirty hacks. Go network stack task force!
- sensors: pins can work in mysterious ways?
- play: hard things are made easy (websockets), but eay things made hard (figuring out the current link)
- californium: ??
- There seems to be no reference RPL implementation for Linux 
- sensing a plant's humidity too often may electrocute them

## Future work
Now that we've figured out how to put together the building blocks of the Internet of Plants, we have a great platform to further experiment with. We've come up with ideas for future extensions and improvements for watr.li, and we'd like to share them with you.

### Plant-to-plant coordination

### Custom plant node cases

### Light sensing

### Battery life experience

### More customization options


What do you think? Which crucial feature would you like to see in watr.li? What were thing we could've done better, or differently?
