In the last TODO weeks, we have been working hard on watr.li. Today marks the deadline for the Eclipse IoT Challenge, so we'd like to take the opportunity to summarize what we've made.  
In this wrap-up post, we do not only want to present the fruits of our labour, but also go into what we've learned, which mistakes we made, and which future steps we'd like to take with watr.li.

## Introducing watr.li

<!-- EMBED VIDEO HERE -->

TODO: fancy words.

## Outtakes

<!-- Where we fucked up, what we could've done better, what we underestimated... -->
- microcoap: level of embedded implementations: YMMV; nodes are asusmed to be so dumb that they have to be asked for their data instead of sending it autonomously
- network stack: without ND, we're forced to employ dirty hacks. Go network stack task force!
- sensors: pins can work in mysterious ways?
- play: hard things are made easy (websockets), but easy things made hard (figuring out the current link)
- californium: ??
- There seems to be no reference RPL implementation for Linux 
- sensing a plant's humidity too often may electrocute them

## Future work
Now that we've figured out how to put together the building blocks of the Internet of Plants, we have a great platform to further experiment with. We've come up with ideas for future extensions and improvements for watr.li, and we'd like to share them with you.

### Battery life experience
During the development process, our plant nodes have been powered by cable or spare Accupacks made for smartphones we had lying around. Our next step will be to connect them to li-ion batteries which are smaller in size (and energy capacity) and experiment with their lifetime.

### Custom plant node cases
Up until now, our prototype plant nodes have been lying around close to their plant's pots. This is not feasible in the long term, as it is ugly, dangerous for the electronics involved, and annoying to move and clean. Designing a case which holds the battery and the SAM R21 board safely above the soil and lets us plug the sensor firmly into the ground would be a major improvement. One way to create such a case could be with the help of a 3D printer. (In case you happen to have one: please do get in touch! ;))

### Plant-to-plant coordination
In our current network, Plant Nodes only communicate with the Display Node, forming a tree-like topology with the Display Node at its root, acting as a so-called “sink node”. This is perfectly common for many IoT environments. In fact, the [Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6550), which watr.li currently uses to establish connections throughout the network, is optimized for exactly this situation.  
However, the IoT is not just about conversations between things and humans. Machine to machine (or rather, thing to thing) communication is a central aspect of the IoT, and we believe it should be part of the Io*P*, too. In the future of watr.li, we want to enable plants to talk amongst each other, forming a mesh- rather than a tree topology. This could enable plants to coordinate their findings amongst each other, and report new or more detailed data. It could also save energy, since not all communication has to go through the Display Node. This adaption may require us to switch routing protocols, but since RIOT offers alternatives to RPL such as AODVv2 and OLSRv2 [(in progress)](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/2294), that should be feasible.

### Light sensing
Apart from water, plants also need light. Some plants need a lot of it, while others prefer more shady environments. Equipping our plant nodes with light sensors would help plants to monitor if they are getting the amount of light they need. In case of under- or overexposure, humans can then be instructed to find a better spot for the affected plant. And with plant-to-plant communication enabled as described above, plants could even gossip among themselves about their accommodation and calculate which plants should switch places, which can then be reported back to the humans.

### More customization options

What do you think? Which crucial feature would you like to see in watr.li? What were thing we could've done better, or differently?
