The [Constrained Application Protocol](TODO: link to explanation article) enables us to exchange data between nodes in the Internet of Plants using a request/reply cycle similar to that of HTTP. 

<motivation: why this setup?>
- interop tests
- only server @ nodes

<ff copper plugin> -> link to lucas' into?


## marz: feeding RIOT traffic from the outside
<marz motivation & intro>
- traffic needs to be tunneled “into” RIOT nativenet & back

RIOT features a so-called “native port” which lets you run your RIOT binary inside a normal Linux thread. To enable it, you simply have to set ``BOARD ?= native`` in the makefile.
This is awesome because it lets you debug things easily without having to flash your nodes all the time, and because you can test your wireless functionality in a safe environment, eliminating possible Layer 0 sources of errors. Networking with the RIOT native port is done through tun/tap devices and bridges.
Now, if we want to use Copper to debug our RIOT CoAP app interactively, we need to tunnel the traffic into a tap device which is connected to our RIOT instance.

## setup howto
The following section will walk you through the setup of a CoAP envornment consisting of a RIOT application which can talk to the Copper plugin through a marz tunnel.

<marz setup & installation.. how do I account for a RIOT installation here?>
