##Intro:
- Tasks of a routing protocol
- IoP/MANET routing quirks

## Why we chose RPL
- currently only plant 2 sink node communication. this is what RPl was made for

## Why that may change
- more plant2plant, less plant2sink node: RPL would drain close plant's batteries. choose meshier approach instead!
- -> Go for AODV2 or port P2PRPL
