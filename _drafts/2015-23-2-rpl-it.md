# RPL - create the Daemon [early draft, really]

To run RPL on the R-IDGE USB router we need to obtain the provided RPL deamon for the from [rosand-tech.com](http://rosand-tech.com/downloads/index.html)
The RPM and deb packages provided on the download site are unfortunately not available for the RasPI, so we need to build the deamon from source.

 - Fist we download the provided source `rpld_1.00-001.tar.gz` tarball from [here](http://rosand-tech.com/downloads/rpld_1.00-001.tar.gz).
    - entering `wget http://rosand-tech.com/downloads/rpld_1.00-001.tar.gz` in a terminal does this for us.
 - Then we extract the tarball by entering `tar -xvfz rpld_1.00-001.tar.gz` in the same directory we downloaded the archive,
 which creates a sub-directory `rpld`.
 - The source for the RPL daemon is a bit aged (from Sp. 2012) and the used APIs for handling routes in the Linux kernel evolved since then.
 That said, trying to compile the source out-of-the-box will fail.
 - To solve this age problem, we need to patch the outdated source to use the provided API properly
    - we prepared the `evolove_rpld.patch` file to do this for us
    - first we switch to the directory where we extracted the `rpld_1.00-001.tar.gz` tarball,
    i.e. the `rpld` directory
    - now we download the `evolove_rpld.patch` form github by .....


[THIS SHOULD BE A .patch file on github]:

  - The `evolove_rpld.patch` file changes the API calls form the `rpld` source to use the new API for accessing functions in the netlink service.
  - With the `evolove_rpld.patch` file at hand we use the `patch` command to apply the changes to the according files we want to evolve.
  - We enter `patch -p1 evolove_rpld.patch` applying the API changes to the affected files.

 - After the preparation, entering `make all` successfully builds the `rpld` binary for the RasPI.
  - it crates the `rpld` binary and a `rpld.8 manpage` with instructions how the rpld is ment to be used.

 - To store the both files we create a new directory by entering `mkdir ../rpld-bin`,
 and copy them to it `cp rpld ../rpld-bin && cp rpld.8 ../rpld-bin`.

 - Now we have the RPL daemon ready to be fire our R-IDGE USB router

## RPL - revive the Daemon [even earlier draft, I mean it]

In one earlier blogpost we introduced how to prepare the R-IDGE USB router to be used as network Interface on the RasPI.
By compiling the `rpld` we have now all the tools at hand to let the R-IDGE USB router act as **RPL root** for a topology with the samr21-xpro IoT nodes.

To start the RPL daemon, we first switch to the `rpld-bin` directory. There we copied the `rpld` executable and the `rpld.8` manpage.
First lets take a look in the manpage of the `rpld`.
We enter `man rpld.8`, which presents us with a short description of the `rpld`, its parameters and an example at the end of the manpage.

_Note: to navigate a manpage just use the arrow up and down keys on your keyboard, to close a manpage just hit the q key._

After getting an idea how to use the `rpld`, we close the manpage by hitting the `q` key.
Now lets revive the Daemon, we enter `sudo ./rpld -i usb0` to do this.
This will start it as application (not Deamonized) to allow us to easily stop it by hitting `ctrl+c`.

_Note: you can have a look what `usb0/rpld` does, i.e. what messages are distributed and received, by using [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
or a similar tool._
The application starts a RPL Daemon (in application-mode) using the `usb0` device and announcing the default DAG ID `1110:0011:1010:10`.

At this point we need to switch to the samr21-xpro nodes to prepare them to talk to our RPL Daemon.

## RPL - make the nodes talk [even more early draft]

As described earlier in a blogpost we learned how to build flash and communicate with the samr21-xpro node.
To enable the samr21-xpro node connect to the DODAG provided by the now running R-IDGE USB router RPL Daemon,
we need to build and flash the `RIOT/examples/rpl_usb` example.
Unfortunately, the path cost calculation of the RPL storing mode of operation (MOP) seems to be currently broken,
so we need to apply the watr.li [Pull Request #3](https://github.com/watr-li/RIOT/pull/3) by entering:
`git pull https://github.com/BytesGalore/RIOT watrli_bypass_path_cost_calculation`.
This will just bypass the calculation based on broken metric measurements.

[TODO: describe Un-blacklist the samr21-xpro for rpl_udp example]

After we applied this hack,we can move on to build and flash the `rpl_udp` example.
When we are finished with flashing, and connected to the RIOT terminal, we first check what functions the example provides by entering `help`.
This will present us the following to execute:

    2015-02-23 10:23:34,827 - INFO # route                Shows the routing table

Now lets recap what we need to parametrize our nodes:
1. the channel must be equal for all participants in the Network. We can check the channel by entering `chan`.
This will present us with:

    2015-02-23 10:26:36,203 - INFO # [transceiver] Got channel: 11

or similar.

As we parametrized the channel for the R-IDGE USB router to 21 in earlier steps, we also set the channel for the node to 21.
We enter `chan 21` and are presented with:

    2015-02-23 10:28:21,768 - INFO # > chan 21
    2015-02-23 10:28:21,769 - INFO #
    2015-02-23 10:28:21,770 - INFO # [transceiver] Trying to set channel 21
    2015-02-23 10:28:21,771 - INFO # [transceiver] Got channel: 21


2. the pan ID must be also equal for the participants, so we first check the current set PAN ID by entering `pan` presenting us with:

    2015-02-23 10:30:35,046 - INFO # [transceiver] Got pan: 1


In an earlier step we parametrized the R-IDGE USB router to have the pan ID `0x03e9` so we set the pan ID of the node accordingly by entering `pan 1001`, i.e. the decimal representation of `0x03e9`, presenting us with:

    2015-02-23 10:32:46,851 - INFO # [transceiver] Trying to set pan 1001
    2015-02-23 10:32:46,851 - INFO # [transceiver] Got pan: 1001

or similar.

Now we need to parametrize the node to listen/join the `ff02::1a` multicast group, which is used by the `rpld` by default(?) to distribute and receive RPL messages.
To do this, we use the RIOT `ifconfig` command and enter 'ifconfig 0 add ipv6 ff02::1a'.
This is the last parametrization step for the node. Now lets check the parameters to see if we set everything accordingly.
We type `ifconfig`, which presents us with the setup of the RIOT network interface:

    2015-02-23 10:39:58,370 - INFO # Iface   0   HWaddr: 0x5a12 Channel: 21 PAN ID: 0x03e9
    2015-02-23 10:39:58,371 - INFO #             EUI-64: 32-1c-00-8f-31-01-59-80
    2015-02-23 10:39:58,373 - INFO #             Source address mode: short
    2015-02-23 10:39:58,373 - INFO #             Transceivers:
    2015-02-23 10:39:58,374 - INFO #              * at86rf231
    2015-02-23 10:39:58,376 - INFO #             inet6 addr: ff02::1a/128  scope: local [multicast]

In the fist line we see the set channel is 21 the PAN ID 0x03e9 (1001 in decimal), and in the last line we can confirm that we have/joined the `ff02::1a` multicast group.

Now we are ready to roll. We enter `init n` to initialize the samr21-xpro as RPL node.
This lets the node disseminate RPL specific messages that are replied by the R-IDGE `rpld` RPL root, and eventually to join the advertised RPL network (DODAG).
After a short period we will be presented with the following (or similar):


    2015-02-23 10:58:33,279 - INFO # > init n
    2015-02-23 10:58:33,280 - INFO #

    2015-02-23 10:58:45,659 - INFO # IPv6 datagram received (next header: 3A) from fe80::12:4bff:fee4:a83

To check if we participate the RPL topology, we can enter the `dodag` command to show us if we joined the announced DODAG from the `rpld`.
If we are not joined a DODAG (yet), we will be presented with this output:

    2015-02-23 11:06:12,173 - INFO # > dodag
    2015-02-23 11:06:12,174 - INFO #

    2015-02-23 11:06:12,175 - INFO # Not part of a dodag
    2015-02-23 11:06:12,176 - INFO # ---------------------------


If we joined a DODAG the command will present us with the following (or similar) information:

    2015-02-23 11:00:47,225 - INFO # dodag
    2015-02-23 11:00:47,226 - INFO #
    2015-02-23 11:00:47,227 - INFO # ---------------------------
    2015-02-23 11:00:47,227 - INFO # Part of Dodag:

    2015-02-23 11:00:47,231 - INFO # ---------------------------

The information tells us that we joined the DODAG with the DAG ID of `1111:11::1100`, have a RPL rank of `512` and our preferred parent is `fe80::12:4bff:fee4:a83`.


At this point the samr21-xpro and the R-IDGE USB router succesfully form a RPL topology, where the R-IDGE acts as parent for the samr21-xpro node.
