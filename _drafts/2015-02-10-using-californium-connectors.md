* The example UDP connector where we just have to change the interface on line https://github.com/eclipse/californium.element-connector/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/elements/UDPConnector.java#L88
* And then add the endpoint with the newly written connector as shown in https://github.com/eclipse/californium/blob/master/cf-secure/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/examples/SecureServer.java#L69
