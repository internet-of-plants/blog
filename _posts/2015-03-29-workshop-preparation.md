For the workshop we will assume that you are familiar with the basics of the following:

- Using a linux terminal
- The C programming language

However, first and foremost, we're here to learn and help each other. You don't have to know everything in order to be able to participate. If you're unsure about anything, or feel that you'd like some help, please do not hesitate to ask the RIOT team. We know that it may be a lot to grasp at once, and we're happy to answer all questions, no matter how trivial they may seem.


# Development environment

RIOT requires you to install and compile some dependencies. We've prepared a VMware Virtual Machine which is all set up and ready to go. We will distribute said virtual machine via USB sticks at the beginning of the workshop. To use it, you will need to have VMware installed on your system. Trials are available at [vmware.com](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads).

In case you prefer to set everyting up yourself, you can follow [this guide](http://watr.li/samr21-dev-setup-ubuntu.html) up until (but not including) the section “Building a RIOT example application”.

RIOT does have experimental Windows support. If you'd prefer to use Windows as your host system, you can consult [this guide](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Build-RIOT-on-Windows-OS), but it doesn't cover how to flash an application. However, a word of warning: you probably know much more about your Windows machine than we do, and we might not be able to help you in case you run into trouble.

We are looking forward to seeing you at the workshop! If there are any preliminary questions about the workshop, feel free to ping us [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/watr_li) or drop us an email to [xoxo@watr.li](mailto:xoxo@watr.li).
